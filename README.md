Abstract 
The Smart Greenhouse Management System (SGMS) is designed to optimize greenhouse operations by integrating automation, IoT sensors, and real-time data analytics. This final phase delivers a seamless system for controlling temperature, humidity, light intensity, and nutrient supply through a centralized interface. The project demonstrates AI-based decision-making, environmental adaptation, and predictive maintenance features. This document outlines the entire system lifecycle, including demonstration insights, architecture diagrams, performance data, source code documentation, and testing evaluations. The SGMS ensures efficiency, scalability, and enhanced plant growth in modern agriculture.
